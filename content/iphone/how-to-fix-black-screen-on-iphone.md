### **3. Initial Troubleshooting Steps**
Before diving into complex solutions, start with basic troubleshooting steps to determine the cause of the problem.

## **4. Checking for Physical Damage**
Inspect your iPhone for any signs of physical damage. Cracks, dents, or water exposure can contribute to black screen issues.

A force restart can resolve many software-related issues causing the black screen. The steps vary slightly depending on the iPhone model.
